# ml-greenroots

`ml-greenroots` is a [Pet-Project](https://www.yourdictionary.com/pet-project) to code Machine Learning in the Browser using various Libraries and Frameworks available. The primary intestion is to have fun with some learning around it!

# Image Classification using ML5js and React
Image Classification is a machine learning problem where we define a set of targets(objects like, Car, Cat, Dog, Boat etc. to identify in the images ), train a model to recognized them using labeled example(sample) photos.

There are plenty of options out there to try JavaScript based ML library or tool-kit to do Machine Learning in the browser. Some are to solve basic problems and few are advanced like, TensorFlow.JS.

 - For my use-case I opted for a Friendly Machine Learning library for Web called, ml5.js. This library provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser, building on top of TensorFlow.js with no other external dependencies.
 - Reactjs, simply because I love it! You can use any other UI libraies or Framework of your choice.

Browse to `/src/pages/ML5ImageClassification.js` to see the code for it.
